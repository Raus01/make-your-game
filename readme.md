# MAKE-YOUR-GAME
Tetris

## Project objectives

Game runs at at least 60 FPS at all times
No frame drops!
Proper use of RequestAnimationFrame
It is very hard to predict performances in JS. So measure performances to see if your code is fast. This will be tested!
Pause menu, that includes:
Continue
Restart
A score board that displays the following metrics:
Countdown clock or Timer that will indicate the amount of time the player has until the game ends or the time that the game has been running
Score that will display the current score (XP or points)
Lives that shows the number of lives that the player has left
The use of layers must be minimal but not zero in order to optimize the rendering performance.
You must not use frameworks or canvas, the game must be implemented using plain JS/DOM and HTML only

## Opening the game

To play open index.html on live server in Visual Studio Code.
